The course is going well so far. It is very 
challenging, but I have learned alot of new things including
Rmarkdown to create documents and GitHub for version control.
I also like that we have to write explanations in
the homework assignments. It has helped me better
understand concepts and not just how to code.

The course has been very time consuming the last week or so. 
I would change the number of homework assignments 
to one per week and maybe less overlap between
homeworks, projects, and exams.

Overall the course has been great so far!
