My view of a data scientist has changed a little bit since the beginning of the course because I don’t think I realized how much statistics was involved. I used R before the course, but I had never really used any of the modeling capabilities of R. I also didn’t realize apps were related to data science too.

R is a great language to use for data analysis and data science. I will definitely use R going forward for analyzing data sets and hopefully some of the modeling capabilities and app development.

Now that I’ve taken this course I am going to use R markdown and Github when using R rather than just Rscripts. R markdown will help me communicate my findings better and Github will help with version control and sharing code.
