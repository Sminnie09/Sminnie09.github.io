If I had to do the project again I would start with the template file before jumping into the automation. I would also look at different variables to draw better conclusions. It was difficult for me to wrap my head around how the render function worked by calling a template from another file. The hardest part of the project for me was getting the automation to work. It was also difficult to draw conclusions from the analysis so more exploratory analysis was probably needed. The big takeaways for me are even more knowledge about how github works and rmarkdown. I learned that you can link to other files in markdown files on github and about parameters and the render function in rmarkdown.
