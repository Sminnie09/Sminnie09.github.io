The vignette created for project 1 discusses background on JSON data, the packages available to read JSON data into R, functions to pull data from APIs, contingency tables, numeric summaries, and plots. The vignette includes five functions that retrieve data from the ‘NHL Records Franchise’ API. The data pulled from the API include: franchise data, franchise team totals, season records, goalie records, and skater records.  The link to the Github repository is here: https://sminnie09.github.io/ST558Project1Repo/

Based on the exploratory analysis done in this vignette on select franchises, some findings include there are more inactive players in the NHL records than active players, the New York Rangers and the Edmonton Oilers have significantly less R position players, R position players play the most games, there is very little variation in the number of losses by the franchises, and there may be an association between number of games played and most goals in one season. 

I would add more plots and look at more franchises for the same variables to draw better conclusions if I were to go through the project again. 

The most difficult part of the project was setting up a repository on Github and remembering to commit/push changes to Github for version control. It was also difficult in the beginning to set up the functions to pull data from the API and figure out how to put it in a well-formatted parsed format to work with for the analysis.

The big take-aways from this project are experience with Github repositories, Github for version control and more experience working with rMarkdown.
