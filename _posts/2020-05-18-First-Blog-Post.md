I think being a data scientist is about being able to analyze large datasets through the use of different programming languages and the use of statistics to make predictions. Data scientists also have to be able to identify patterns in the data in order to draw conclusions. One of the most important things about being a data scientist is being able to communicate the findings from the data to the business or whoever is the audience.

I think some of the major knowledge areas for a data scientist are statistics, programming, and mathematics. Some of the major duties for a data scientist are developing statistical models for analysis, communicating findings to the business, building tools to monitor and analyze performance and data, developing predictive models, and designing experiments to measure the impact of an experiment.

I think some of the differences between a data scientist and a statistician are the size of the datasets they analyze and how they handle the data. Data scientists usually handle larger datasets than statisticians therefore data scientists are usually equipped with more programming and database skills to handle the larger datasets. Some of the similarities are data scientists and statisticians both use statistics and make predictions based on the findings in the data.

I view myself as closer to a data scientist because I used programming and databases to analyze large environmental datasets from environmental models in my previous job and drew conclusions and made recommendations based on the model output.
